# Privacy Policy
WetherOrNot takes your privacy and personal data seriously. WetherOrNot will only retrieve the least information that is necessary for finding your local weather data. Since WetherOrNot does not use any third party services and only uses the WeatherKit service provided by Apple, your personal data is NEVER tracked nor sold to any third parties.  

You may opt to grant WetherOrNot access to your location to receive localized weather forecasts but it is NOT required. However, for the most accurate weather forecasts location permission is recommended. You can enable location access by selecting to allow location access "While Using the App" or "Always". You can always change the granted location access for WetherOrNot on your devices' settings.

WetherOrNot does not use any third party services for analytics. However, it does utilize Apple's App Analytics platform to collect statistics on app crashes and usage. This information helps to diagnose and resolve any issues when encountered. This data is anonymous and cannot be used to personally identify users.
